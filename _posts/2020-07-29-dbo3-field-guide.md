# Journey of a Package Through the Warehouse

A package starts off in the tractor trailer. An Amazon Associate (AA) takes the package from the tractor trailer
and places it on the conveyor belt. Another AA with a (sticker gun) scans the the package and puts the printed sticker
on the package. This sticker shows which bag that the package needs to be stowed in.

The packages are placed on the conveyor belts pictured below and go up the big iron to divert.

From here an AA *diverts* the package to the correct cluster by placing it in the correct chute.
The chutes that the package can go through are labeled HJ, AB, CD, and EG. The picture below shows
the where a diverter stands and the chutes that the packages go down.

Once the package is put through one of those
chutes, another conveyor belt takes it to its aisle. From there, it goes down another conveyor belt like the one 
pictured below. This is the CD cluster.

An AA stands at the beginning of this conveyor belt and *splits* the packages. This means that
they move the package to the correct side of the conveyor belt. This shows the chute that the packages
come down from and where the splitter works.

*Pullers* stand on each side of the conveyor belt and put the packages onto the correct shelves.
*Stowers* take packages from the shelves and put them in the correct bags. The video below
shows a stower moving packages from the shelf into the bags.
