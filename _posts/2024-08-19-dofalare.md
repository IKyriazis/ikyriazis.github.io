Have you ever heard of a μπουζούκι (bouzouki)? It's my favorite instrument. The sound it emits when a virtouso picks it is next level. See for yourself.

I fell so hard for this instrument that I decided to get my own and learn how to play. I discovered that a lot of the material that teaches songs uses the solfege system instead of the letter notation that I was used to when learning guitar. As an english speaker I know the order of the letters quite well. For example, in my head I instantly know that 2 letters down from A is C, 3 letters before F is C etc..

I can't do that with the solfege system just yet, so I made a web app to help train my mental model and hopefully others who want to learn the order of the solfege system better.

As I was testing it, I realized that it was kind of fun. So I decided to expand upon the "game" aspect of it and add a leaderboard. Oh, also when you finish it tells you how your score compares to everyone else.

## Tech Details
I used [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) for the whole web app. They're a killer combo. Ever since I re-wrote the [VRSCO](https://vrsco.chat) site in Astro and Svelte I haven't looked back. 

Astro runs the backend functionality that the leaderboard and percentile stat uses. Astro is also responsible for the frontend. Since this web app relies heavily on JavaScript, I wrote components in Svelte. The cool thing about Astro is that I can use basically any framework to make components and mix and match them into the same web app. And it loads them at the time that they're needed so your site isn't unneccesarily slowed. I use a MySQL database to store all the data needed for the leaderboard and percentile stat.


Bonus: I will venmo $10 to the first person who can tell me why I named it dofalare. Message me [here](https://vrsco.chat/cachedchat/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001)
