I created this business site for [Canvas Kicks](https://canvaskicks.store). Prospective clients go to this site
so they can see previous completed orders and get an idea of what Canvas Kicks can paint. Users can also contact
Canvas Kicks through the "Message Me!" link in the navbar.

Here are some features of the site that I'd like to point out.

First, we have the ability to add comments to a post. To add a comment, a user must be signed in to the website. A user can
log in through the interface in the top right of the [Completed orders page](https://canvaskicks.store/prevWorks.html).

Posts can include more than one photo. The images below shows what a post with multiple photos looks like.

If you press the right arrow the second image appears, as shown below.

As I mentioned earlier, clients can also send a message to Canvas Kicks through the [Message Me! page](https://canvaskicks.store/messageme.html).
Below is a screenshot of the page.

To make adding posts to the website as easy as possible (no programming experience needed), I created an interface for
Canvas Kicks to log into to see messages, add posts, edit posts, and delete posts. Below is a screenshot of the interface.
