# Journey of a Package Through the Warehouse

A package starts off in the tractor trailer. An Amazon Associate (AA) takes the package from the tractor trailer
and places it on the conveyor belt. Another AA with a (sticker gun) scans the the package and puts the printed sticker
on the package. This sticker shows which bag that the package needs to be stowed in.

| *This sticker shows that the package must go in the bag 4D in aisle 5 of the C cluster.* |

The packages are placed on the conveyor belts pictured below and go up the big iron to divert.

From here an AA *diverts* the package to the correct cluster by placing it in the correct chute.
The chutes that the package can go through are labeled HJ, AB, CD, and EG. The picture below shows
the where a diverter stands and the chutes that the packages go down.

Once the package is put through one of those
chutes, another conveyor belt takes it to its aisle. From there, it goes down another conveyor belt like the one 
pictured below. This is the CD cluster.

An AA stands at the beginning of this conveyor belt and *splits* the packages. This means that
they move the package to the correct side of the conveyor belt. This shows the chute that the packages
come down from and where the splitter works.

*Pullers* stand on each side of the conveyor belt and put the packages onto the correct shelves.
*Stowers* take packages from the shelves and put them in the correct bags. The video below
shows a stower moving packages from the shelf into the bags.

After all the packages are stowed in their bags we *pick* the bags and put them on a U-boat.
Sometimes if the packages don't fit in bags they are stored outside of a bag.
The picture below shows two U-boats filled with bags and oversize packages.

The bags and packages wait on this cart until the Amazon delivery drivers pack everything
into their vans.
