What started off as a way to conveniently share my own zoom meeting link turned into an application where my friends, professors, and
anyone on the internet could conveniently share their own zoom link. All you need is to make an account, sign in, paste your zoom
link and come up with a shortcut. To illustrate, https://wpi.zoom.us/j/5057214268 (something difficult to remember) becomes zoom.ioannis.ky/ioannis
(an easy thing to remember).

Make your own link [here](https://zoom.ioannis.ky)

Built using NodeJS, HTML5/CSS3/JS, Bootstrap, and mongoDB.

Future additions:
- dashboard to view all links created
- editable shortcuts
