To learn about graphics in the web browser, my friend and I created an online 3D maze rendered completely in the web browser using [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/). You can access it at
[maze.ioannis.ky](https://maze.ioannis.ky). Below is a screenshot of the first maze (the simpler one we hard coded).

We then found a library called [aframe-maze-component](https://github.com/mitchallen/aframe-maze-component) that autogenerates a maze given a length
and width. Aframe-maze-component was useful so that we didn't have to hardcode each wall. It was also better at drawing
the images on the maze walls.
Below is a screenshot of the second maze that we generated with aframe-maze-component.
